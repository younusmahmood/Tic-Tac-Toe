Tic Tac Toe
Author: Younus Mahmood

How To Connect:

Included in the submission are two files: Server.java, Client.java
There are two ways to run these files to get the proper output.

1)	Load into eclipse (or any other java IDE), run the server, then run the client twice
2)	Open command line, navigate to where both server and client are stored, compile and run from there. Open second and third window and run the client file twice in separate windows.

How to play:

Once you have the two clients running on the server, the next steps are pretty straightforward:

1)	Click “Connect to Opponent” on each client end
2)	Based on which one is clicked first, the server will assign either “X” or “O”
3)	Once you see what you have been assigned, you’re good to play!
4)	Simple click on the button you wish to choose, but you only have 15 seconds so decide quickly!
5)	If you have never played Tic-Tac-Toe before, simple press the help button and a message box will display showing you how to play. 
6)	If you decide this isn’t the game for you, feel free to hit the quit button and exit.
7)	If you need help making a decision on where to put your piece, hit the tip button! It will display a number such as “9” which simple means to click the 9th button on the board
    a.	Note: The tip button is not an AI nor was it meant to be, so it is fairly simple to beat and outwit. 
8)	You are ready to move on and play some Tic-Tac-Toe!!
